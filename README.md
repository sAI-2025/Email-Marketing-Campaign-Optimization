# 📧 **Email Marketing Campaign Optimization: Data Science Analysis**

Welcome to the project focused on analyzing and optimizing email marketing campaigns to improve user engagement. This analysis delves into the relationship between various user and campaign features and their impact on email open and click-through rates (CTR). By leveraging decision trees, conditional probabilities, and visualization techniques, we aim to help marketers enhance their strategies and boost campaign success.

### 🎯 **Main Goal**

The primary goal is to **analyze user behavior** and **optimize email marketing campaigns** by understanding:
- Who opens emails and clicks on links?
- Which user features drive these actions?
- How to predict and improve engagement?

---

### 🧠 **Business Case**

The marketing team sends promotional emails, but only a small fraction opens and clicks the links. Understanding the underlying factors and predicting future behavior will allow for better-targeted campaigns, ultimately improving engagement and **ROI**.

**Key Questions**:
- Why do some users open or click emails while others do not?
- Can we predict who will click next time?
- How can we personalize campaigns to improve engagement?

### 🏢 **Business Model**

This analysis is aligned with a **SaaS/E-commerce** business model, where:
- **Email Campaigns** drive marketing efforts.
- **Purchases** from email links generate revenue.
- **User Retention** and **growth** are critical for long-term success.

Optimizing email strategies improves **customer lifetime value (CLV)**, **ROI**, and overall business performance.

### 🔹 **Key Analysis Components**

- **Open Rate & Click Rate Calculation**:
  - `open_rate = (opened_emails / total_emails) * 100`
  - `click_rate = (clicked_emails / total_emails) * 100`

- **User & Feature Insights**:
  - Impact of **Email Text** (Short vs. Long)
  - Influence of **Personalization** on user engagement
  - **Time & Day**: Identifying the best hours and weekdays for higher engagement
  - **Past Purchases**: How user history affects email open and click behavior

### 📊 **Key Visualizations & Insights**

1. **Frequency of Emails Clicked**: Analyzing which emails (short vs. long) perform better in terms of clicks.
2. **Email Distribution by Country**: Identifying engagement patterns based on user geography.
3. **Email Open vs Click**: Comparing the number of opened emails to the clicked ones.
4. **Country-wise Email Open Rates**: Tailoring marketing strategies based on country-specific data.
5. **Impact of Past Purchases on Engagement**: Users with a higher number of past purchases tend to engage more.

### 📅 **Key Findings from Conditional Probability Analysis**

- **Weekday-wise Engagement**:
  - Best Day: **Wednesday** (2.76% click probability)
  - Worst Day: **Friday** (1.40% click probability)

- **Hour-wise Engagement**:
  - Best Hour: **11 PM** (4.14% click probability)
  - Worst Hour: **9 PM** (0.82% click probability)

- **Email Version Impact**:
  - Personalized emails saw a **2.73% click rate**, nearly double that of generic emails (**1.51%**).

- **Past Purchases**:
  - **21–50 past purchases** had the highest probability of click engagement (**60%**), while users with no purchases had a **0.05%** probability.
